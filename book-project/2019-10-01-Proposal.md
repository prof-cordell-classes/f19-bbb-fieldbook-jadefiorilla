# Book Project: Proposal

#### Jade Fiorilla

Content:

* A personal update to my friends who I don't get to see very often, kind of like a chunky, 3D, crafty newsletter
* A means of connecting all of us and forming a tighter bond
* Will have different sections per page, as if it were a newsletter (one-sided due to materials)
	* Informal Q&A/introduction
	* My cat update
	* Recipe
	* My thoughts OR a friend profile
	* Poem sharing
	* Nature fun fact
	* Something I'm curious about 
	* Call for "submissions" 
* Designed so I could make more of these, perhaps one per season (I will make believe this is the fall issue)
* I hope to make two or three copies of this book to give to two or three close friends, which is why there aren't so many sections/pages per copy

Format:

* On the spectrum between zine and book; a deliberate audience with content primarily about myself, however it will not being readily reproducable
* Multimedia (ink, paint, embroidery, collage, photography); physicality matters
	* Letterpress multiple copies of a poem to be loose in book for my friends to give to their friends
	* Typewriter to write main protions of text in book
	* Pen to write personal asides/comments unique to each production
	* Paint & embroidery to provide visual contrast between textural and visual diversity (illustration)
	* Collage and photography add texture and charm that tell the reader my hands made this, as opposed to digitally layered images 
* Perhaps square dimensions, thick, substantial (heavy cover and paper material)
* Hand bound (I've always wanted to try sewing techniques!)

Skills:

* How to hand bind a book, especially a book I hope to be fairly thick
* After talking with Kenny, I may experiment with color blending on the proofing press 

Materials:

* A trip to Blick for heavy cover and paper material, glue, and maybe some acryclic paint
	* Not opposed to using a different material for the cover than a paper product...
* I already have a typewriter, pens, water color, and embroidery material 
* I will need to try to find a source of collage material (old magazines from my mom, around campus? Open to suggestions!) 

Equiptment:

* Access to the letterpress studio for at least one or two elements 
* Will need to get my typewriter from home (shouldn't be a problem)

Team:

* This is an individual project

Evaluation:

* My goal is to create content for my friends, for people I am intimate/genuinely myself with; I want to create a sense of belonging that I feel I sometimes lack at a big university like Northeastern 
* I hope to create a home in this book where my friends and I live next to each other and eat dinner together and see each other regularly
* I think this project can be evaluated by my tone (journal vs. book rhetoric) and the seamless blend of technqiues that speak to my creative side
* I think it can also be evaluated by whether the visual design flows with intention and physical/mental effort, how it presents as handmade and sincere, if it comforting to hold
* Part of the evaluation I think should be that I produce multiple copies
