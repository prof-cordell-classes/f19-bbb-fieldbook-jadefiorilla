# Reading Prep: What is a Book?

#### Jade Fiorilla

## Questions or Observations
First Half

1. I’m not going to lie—it’s hard for me to consider literature as a performance (55). I enjoy the fact that reading is an individual activity, I define it as such. But perhaps the point is that my reading habits are owed to historical orality and rhapsody, that literature was performance before it was private. 
2. Socrates was afraid that writing separates ideas from their source, inviting misunderstanding (55). I would argue, however, that I like writing because it’s open-ended, because I am not tied to the finished product. Interpretations are another form of sharing that start their own conversations. Do we always have to own our ideas? Defend them? 
3. It’s interesting to think that, 90% of the time, the form of codices are taken for granted by an author. Particularly when I think about big name, bestselling authors, I doubt they give much thought to anything beyond their plot and character development. (In response to: “materials in turn shaped the content with which such books were filled,” 111)


Second Half

1. According to Scott McCloud, graphic novels are a form of sequential art. Thus, it’s interesting to hear books being discussed as a “sequence of spaces” (143). I’ve never put much thought into the fact that books, like graphic novels, require viewer interaction to function (145). Unlike a movie, which can play to an empty room to conclusion, books need an audience to be used. This is one argument for seeing video games as books that I grasp easily; the storytelling only comes alive because of our actions and attention (251).
2. I feel the need to advocate for words in art books (150). In general, I think words have a reputation of describing and detailing, while images have the reputation of organically provoking the mind. I would argue that words can be more freeing than images. Words can capture the abstract matter whereas images need at least some concrete  elements (i.e. color, size, layering) in order to exist, in order for us to understand them. 
3. The interplay between me greatly enjoying the physicality of a book and greatly enjoying the content of a book is a funny thing (258). I read Steinbeck’s “Pastures of Heaven” in a fat volume the dimensions of a moleskin. The pages were as smooth as vellum. I loved the short story and the flow of character narratives. More recently I read “Middlegame” by Seanan McGuire and although the thickness, dimensions, and paper were different from the Steinbeck, I raced through this book as well. Perhaps a good lasting impression can only be achieved when the content and the object both impress the reader.
