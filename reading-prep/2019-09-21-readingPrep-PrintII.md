## Questions or Observations

1. I find it fascinating that a "distorted alphabet" could induce people to worry about the consequences "the 'dangers' of [such] exaggeration" could impose on society. The fact that type might affect our consciousness may seem ridiculous at first, but then when we realize how universal text is and how it influences our perspective (i.e. serif is professional and informational) it becomes more probable. Tangentially, it's also interesting how text reflects our cultural progression into a world of "monster fonts".
2. Discussing typography as a mode of interpretation reminds me of my brief stint as an architecture student. The built environment influences us incredibly, typically without us being aware of its force. Similarly, the spatial design of text affects how we read, just like light and procession are manipulated in everyday buildings and cities, affecting our perspective. 
3. When talking about dropped capitals and letter press, I was curious as to how the metal type fits around the woodcut. I was also wondering about a woodcut being hand-carved versus machine-made, and what the same designs traditionally woodcut may be called if made via 3D printing...This modern change intrigues me, as currently the mix of woodcut and metal type recalls past decorations and hand painted illuminations, but with new technology and materials, I might suggest such ornamentation may feel phony or insincere.
